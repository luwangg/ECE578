578 Midterm Study

Topics to Study:

LFSR's:
Overview:
LFSR's are stream ciphers made up of Flip-Flops


Possible states: 2^m, m=number of storage elements, excludes all zero state
	-sequence repeates after 2^m outputs

If the sequence lengths of all LFSRs are relatively prime to each other, then the
sequence length of the generator is the product of all three sequence lengths L=L1*L2*L3....

A secure generator should have LFSRs of roughly equal lengths and the length should be at least 128
